This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting loan statuses using machine learning techniques. 
The project analyzes loan data to determine whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected based on given features.

Steps Involved:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Implementation of machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation and performance metrics
